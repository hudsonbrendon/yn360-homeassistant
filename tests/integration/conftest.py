"""Fixtures for Yongnuo YN360 integration tests.

The integration depends on ``bluetooth_adapters`` (and thus ``bluetooth``), so
every integration test needs the bluetooth stack mocked and set up. The
``enable_bluetooth`` fixture from pytest-homeassistant-custom-component mocks the
adapters and scanner, sets up a bluetooth config entry, and unloads it on
teardown (which cancels the manager's unavailable-check timer).

On non-Linux hosts the plugin's adapter mock forces ``platform.system`` to
"Linux" but leaves ``LinuxAdapters.history`` unpatched; that property reaches
into dbus and crashes here, so we patch it to an empty history. The patch must
be active *before* ``enable_bluetooth`` sets bluetooth up, hence the explicit
fixture ordering.
